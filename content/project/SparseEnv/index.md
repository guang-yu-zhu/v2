## Overview

**SparseEnv** is a versatile statistical tool that implements advanced techniques from two influential papers:

1. Su, Z., Zhu, G., Chen, X., & Yang, Y. (2016). Sparse envelope model: efficient estimation and response variable selection in multivariate linear regression. Biometrika, 103(3), 579-593. [link](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/103/3/579/1744502)
2. Guangyu Zhu. Zhihua Su. (2020) "Envelope-based sparse partial least squares." Ann. Statist. 48 (1) 161 - 182. [link](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-48/issue-1/Envelope-based-sparse-partial-least-squares/10.1214/18-AOS1796.full)

These papers provide the theoretical foundation for SparseEnv, which bridges theory and practice, offering a comprehensive framework for efficient estimation and response variable selection in multivariate linear regression.
