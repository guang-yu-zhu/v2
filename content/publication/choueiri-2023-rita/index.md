abstract: " Objective: To evaluate improved identification and the generalization of the RITA-T (Rapid interactive Screening Test for Autism in Toddlers) model through partnerships with Primary Care (PC), Early Intervention (EI), and Autism Diagnosticians. Methods: Over 3 years (2018-2021), 15 EI and 9 PC (MD and NP) centers participated in this project. We trained providers on the RITA-T and established screening models. We reviewed charts of all toddlers referred through this model and compared wait times, and diagnoses, to those evaluated through regular referral in a tertiary-based autism clinic. We also examined the RITA-T psychometrics. Results: 377 toddlers met our inclusion criteria. Wait time for diagnosis was an average of 2.8 months and led to further collaboration between community providers. RITA-T cut-off scores stayed consistent. Providers reported improved confidence and easy integration of this model. Conclusions: This model is generalizable and improves the Early Identification of ASD. "
