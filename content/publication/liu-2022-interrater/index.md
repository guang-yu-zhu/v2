abstract: "**Background:** Infantile spasms are a serious epilepsy syndrome with a poor prognosis. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been a key component in the prognosis and treatment of infantile spasms. This multi-center study protocol is developed to investigate interrater and intrarater agreement of an electroencephalographic grading scale‚Äîthe Burden of Amplitudes and Epileptiform Discharges (BASED) score among electroencephalographers.<br> **Methods**: Thirty children, aged 0‚Äì2 years, with infantile spasms who were hospitalized in the Chinese PLA General Hospital will be recruited into this study by stratified sampling. Seven electroencephalographers from different Class A tertiary hospitals will select a 5-min epoch with the most severe epileptiform discharge, score the EEG reports, and provide the basis for the scoring. The 420 (30‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ7‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ2) scoring results provided by electroencephalographers in two rounds can be analyzed statistically using weighted kappa (weighted ùúÖ) statstic, Fless‚Äô kappa (Fless‚Äô ùúÖ) statistic, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to calculate the interrater and intrarater agreement.<br> **Discussion**: We will recruit more electroencephalographers than were included in previous studies to assess the interrater and intrarater agreement in the selection of 5-min EEG epochs, the BASED scores, and the basis for scoring. If the BASED score has an adequate interrater and intrarater agreement, the score will have more significance for guiding the clinical management and for predicting the prognosis of patients with infantile spasms."
