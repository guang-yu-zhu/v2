If you have any suggestions for how to make the scale as accessible as possible, please feel free to contact Nick Ballou (nick@nickballou.com). ️ About the BANGQ The Basic Needs in Games (BANGS) is an open-access, free to use scale that assesses video game players’ degree of need satisfaction and frustration. This questionnaire can be used to help understand outcomes such as video game enjoyment, engagement, in-game behavior, and well-being.\nBasic psychological needs are a concept from self-determination theory1. Decades of theory and evidence support the idea that humans have innate and universal needs for:\nAutonomy: the need to feel a sense of control over one’s life and volitional in one’s actions Competence: the need to act effectively and exert mastery in the world Relatedness: the need to feel that one is connected to and valued by others More recent research has shown that satisfaction of these basic psychological is different from their frustration. Need frustration is not simply the absence of need satisfaction, but a separate construct referring to feelings of being controlled or coerced (autonomy frustration), failure and self-doubt (competence frustration), or loneliness and exclusion (relatedness frustration). Evidence suggests that need satisfaction and need frustration are separate experiences that can coexist to varying degrees.\nThe degree to which activities satisfy or frustrate our basic psychological needs has two main consequences for us: (1) it affects our motivation, and therefore our behavior, and (2) it affects our mental health—how much our activities support us in living a full and flourishing life.\nFor motivation, when activities satisfy our basic psychological needs, people tend to be more autonomously motivated to perform those activities—doing them because they are either inherently enjoyable, or because they align with one’s authentic values. When activities frustrate our basic psychological needs, people tend to lose motivation, or (if other factors mean that stopping the activities is a less viable option) continue to perform the activity in an inflexible way.For mental health and wellbeing, when activities satisfy our basic psychological needs, people tend to feel better both during and after the time they spend doing them.\nIn the world of video games, basic psychological needs have been studied extensively, with research showing that they are key ingredients in what makes games ‘fun’2. For example, games may satisfy autonomy through allowing people to build desired avatars customization, satisfy competence by providing them rich feedback about their improvement over time, or satisfy relatedness by providing a social space for players to connect with friends and family through shared attention.\nIn short, basic psychological needs are an important consideration for game designers trying to find out what makes their games engaging, for user researchers trying to understand how people behave in games, and for researchers trying to find out when and why games affect players’ mental health.\nBANGS Items BANGS consists of the following items. Please see this Excel file for complete variants of the questionnaire.\nConstruct Label Item Autonomy Satisfaction bang_01 I could make choices regarding how to play [X]. bang_02 I could play [X] in the way I wanted. bang_03 I could direct my own play experience in [X].

Theirs is an excellent scale and example of how to make research outputs accessible, and we highly encourage you to check it out! ️ The Scale The Basic Needs in Games (BANGS) is an open-access, free to use scale. You can use it to understand how players experience a game or gaming in general. However, to ensure good measurement and fair comparisons, it is important to use the scale as devised. Below, we provide few tips; templates for getting started can be found here Excel file..\nThis is not meant to be guide on how to conduct surveys or how to perform statistical analysis of results. For more general information on conducting survey studies, I point you in the direction of a few useful resources at the bottom of this page.\nHow to use What order should the items be in? We strongly recommend randomizing the order in which items appear. This allows you to better use multiple items to measure the same underlying thing (i.e., the three autonomy satisfaction items) without it being overly obvious or tedious for participants who would have to otherwise fill out several similar items in a row.\nWhat are the response options? BANGS was designed using a 7-pt Likert scale with the following format:\n1 - Strongly disagree 2 3 4 - Neither agree nor disagree 5 6 7 - Strongly agree In one study, we tested an alternative format where the numeric values were changed to range from -3 to +3, instead of 1 to 7. We did not find any evidence that this affected the validity of the measure, so if you feel this better represents your goals with measuring basic needs, this is an alternative option. However, because the majority of our research used a 1 to 7 scale, the -3 to +3 variant should be used with some caution.\nHow do you fill in the blanks? BANGS was tested for three kinds of usage:\nExperiences of a particular game session Experiences of a particular game over time Experiences of gaming in general over time It’s important to be explicit about which of these you are interested in, and measure appropriately. For each, you will need to update the stem text and the placeholder [X]s in each item to suit the context. The table below summarizes the changes you’ll need to make. Fully-updated variants are available in the Excel file.\nVariant Stem Text Replacement for placeholder [X] Particular game session Throughout my session of the game… “the game” Particular game Throughout my experiences playing [name of game]… [name of game] Gaming in general Throughout my experiences playing games in the last [time period]... “the games I played” OR remove [X]s entirely (untested) Scoring If possible, we recommend calculating factor scores based on players’ responses to each item, or using a measurement model—this allows you to account for the fact that each item gives a different amount of information about the underlying construct. Research shows that these scores typically differ somewhat from simply taking the mean of each subscale, and that this can have an appreciable impact on your results.\nIf this is not feasible or convenient, we recommend simply using the mean of all items in each subscale (e.g., the mean of items 1, 2, and 3 for autonomy satisfaction; items 4, 5, and 6 for autonomy frustration, and so on).\nDepending on your research interests, it may be appropriate to calculate the mean of all the need satisfaction items (i.e., satisfaction of autonomy, competence, and relatedness) and the mean of all need frustration items (i.e., frustration of autonomy, competence, and relatedness) as holistic indications of people’s overall need satisfaction and frustration. Note, however, that this will result in the loss of information about which needs are more satisfied or frustrated.\nWe do not recommend calculating a score of all 18 items together (e.g., subtracting the mean of all need frustration items from the mean of all need satisfaction items)—need satisfaction and frustration are separate constructs with different consequences, and are therefore best handled separately.\nGeneral Resources for Conducting Survey Studies Kelley, K., Clark, B., Brown, V., \u0026amp; Sitzia, J.

However, it is pretty challenging to support multiple users via the wireless network since a panoramic scene typically consumes 4∼6× bandwidth compared with a regular video with the same resolution. Motivated by the fact that users only perceive the Field-of-View (FoV), we employ the autoregressive process to predict the user's motion and stream only part of the panoramic content. Notably, we analytically characterize the effect of the delivered portion on the user's successful viewing probability. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the application-level throughput (which measures the average rate for successful viewing the desired content instead of raw network throughput) while providing a regular service. In addition, we impose three main constraints to our problem: minimum required service rate, maximum allowable energy consumption, and wireless interference. We then propose a novel scheduling algorithm that incorporates users' successful viewing probabilities and asymptotically maximizes application-level throughput while providing service regularity guarantees. We conduct real-trace simulations to evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm.","tags":null,"title":"Motion-Prediction-Based Wireless Scheduling for Interactive Panoramic Scene Delivery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roula Choueiri","William T.

Enthusiasm for the development of effective statistical inference procedures for quantiles and their functions has been high for the past decade. In this article, we study inference methods for quantiles when multiple samples from linked populations are available. The research problems we consider have a wide range of applications. For example, to study the evolution of the economic status of a country, economists monitor changes in the quantiles of annual household incomes, based on multiple survey datasets collected annually. Even with multiple samples, a routine approach would estimate the quantiles of different populations separately. Such approaches ignore the fact that these populations are linked and share some intrinsic latent structure. Recently, many researchers have advocated the use of the density ratio model (DRM) to account for this latent structure and have developed more efficient procedures based on pooled data. The nonparametric empirical likelihood (EL) is subsequently employed. Interestingly, there has been no discussion in this context of the EL-based likelihood ratio test (ELRT) for population quantiles. We explore the use of the ELRT for hypotheses concerning quantiles and confidence regions under the DRM. We show that the ELRT statistic has a chi-square limiting distribution under the null hypothesis. Simulation experiments show that the chi-square distributions approximate the finite-sample distributions well and lead to accurate tests and confidence regions. The DRM helps to improve statistical efficiency. We also give a real-data example to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.","tags":null,"title":"Identification of significant gene expression changes in multiple perturbation experiments using knockoffs","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" It’s undeniably great that blogdown/Hugo Academic (now Wowchemy) made creating a professional website so accessible, but there is a notable downside: it became really hard to make your site stand out.\nTo try and leave a slightly more lasting mark, I spent more hours than I’d like to admit googling around, finding little tweaks that would differentiate my website from the standard template. I’m generally happy with the result, and I figured if I could cut down on others’ frustration by sharing what I did, that’s the least I could do. I have no web design experience and struggled throughout with HTML/CSS/Go, as well as with the general structure of the website. In other words, if I can do it, so can you!\nThe full codebase for my website is available on Github.\nThese alterations often failed to work out of the box for me when borrowing others’ code, and they similarly may not work for you. Due to differences in1) Wowchemy versions and idiosyncratic parts of your setup, and 2) poor documentation on my part after too many hours of trial and error, these tips are more about pointing you in the right direction with sources rather than directly solving your problems. Setting up your site These tips assume that you already have a working, deployed version of a Wowchemy site. This is too large a topic to dive into here, but some of the resources I found helpful when first doing this include:\nDan Quintana’s blog post on creating your website Andreas Handel’s post on creating a website in under an hour Wowchemy’s own tutorial/guide (duh) Basics of Wowchemy/Hugo Customization Customizations to your Wowchemy site typically take one of 4 forms:\nChanging a predefined parameter in the config/_default files (mainly params.yaml and config.yaml) Altering a theme in data/themes - for exmaple, I created a file data/themes/my_theme.toml where I set all of the colors for both light and dark mode across the website. I can highly recommend Coolers for trying out different color palettes until you find one you’re happy with. Adding/changing a partial—essentially a bit of code that defines a certain design feature on your website. For example, partials might define where your profile picture appears, the number of columns used to display the content of a given page, the presence of a background image, and much more. Using partials was by far the hardest part of Wowchemy for me to wrap my head around. By default, partials are defined in your theme, and can be found under themes/github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes/modules/wowchemy/v5/layouts/partials (I know, it really feels like they could’ve simplified that folder structure a bit). You should never alter these files in the theme itself. Instead, you should make a copy of partials, and put them in a new folder at the root of your directory: layouts/partials. The partials in your root directory will override the “default” ones in the theme, allowing you to change the design without risking breaking anything—you can always just delete the custom partial. Changing the styling with custom SCSS code (which is just CSS code, but fancier). You can add a file called custom.scss inside assets/scss folder (again, you may need to create this folder first). Within this file, you use CSS code to specify certain elements/classes of elements, and can change their visual properties. This might include the formatting of your headings, various colors or padding, animations (see below), and much more. If you master these four strategies for customizing your website, you’ll have the main tools in your toolkit for making your website stand out from the crowd. As above, it’s beyond the scope of this post to teach you how to do each of these things thoroughly, but here are some resources that helped me:\nThe basics of predefined parameters: Dan Quintana’s blog post on creating your website Getting to grips with custom.scss: Connor Rothschild’s blog post Understanding how partials work: noisyoscillator’s post on customizing Hugo websites; Yorkyard’s getting started with Hugo partials Setting up a Blogdown site from scratch, with lots of custom tweaks, by Mark Druffel Changes on my site About widget The about widget is the first thing your visitors are going to see, and therefore was the aspect I spent the most time customizing.

If the BASED score has an adequate interrater and intrarater agreement, the score will have more significance for guiding the clinical management and for predicting the prognosis of patients with infantile spasms.","tags":null,"title":"Interrater and Intrarater Agreement of Epileptic Encephalopathy Among Electroencephalographers for Children with Infantile Spasms Using the Burden of Amplitudes and Epileptiform Discharges (BASED) EEG Grading Scale: Study Design and Statistical Considerations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Archer Gong Zhang","Guangyu Zhu","Jiahua Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638316800,"objectID":"56a15446d94f162a4d1308a420318e24","permalink":"https://guangyuzhu.rbind.io/publication/zhang-2021-empirical/","publishdate":"2023-11-03T00:48:54.864946Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-2021-empirical/","section":"publication","summary":"Population quantiles are important parameters in many applications. Enthusiasm for the development of effective statistical inference procedures for quantiles and their functions has been high for the past decade. In this article, we study inference methods for quantiles when multiple samples from linked populations are available. The research problems we consider have a wide range of applications. For example, to study the evolution of the economic status of a country, economists monitor changes in the quantiles of annual household incomes, based on multiple survey datasets collected annually. Even with multiple samples, a routine approach would estimate the quantiles of different populations separately. Such approaches ignore the fact that these populations are linked and share some intrinsic latent structure. Recently, many researchers have advocated the use of the density ratio model (DRM) to account for this latent structure and have developed more efficient procedures based on pooled data. The nonparametric empirical likelihood (EL) is subsequently employed. Interestingly, there has been no discussion in this context of the EL-based likelihood ratio test (ELRT) for population quantiles. We explore the use of the ELRT for hypotheses concerning quantiles and confidence regions under the DRM. We show that the ELRT statistic has a chi-square limiting distribution under the null hypothesis. Simulation experiments show that the chi-square distributions approximate the finite-sample distributions well and lead to accurate tests and confidence regions. The DRM helps to improve statistical efficiency. We also give a real-data example to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.","tags":null,"title":"Empirical likelihood ratio test on quantiles under a density ratio model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiangong Chen","Xudong Qin","Guangyu Zhu","Bo Ji","Bin Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619827200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619827200,"objectID":"15869691f633529bf6ad15b12818a1f0","permalink":"https://guangyuzhu.rbind.io/publication/chen-2021-motion/","publishdate":"2023-11-03T00:48:54.854684Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2021-motion/","section":"publication","summary":"Multi-user panoramic video streaming demands 4~6× bandwidth of a regular video with the same resolution, which poses a significant challenge on the wireless scheduling design to achieve desired performance. On the other hand, recent studies reveal that one can effectively predict the user's Field-of-View (FoV) and thus simply deliver the corresponding portion instead of the entire scenes. Motivated by this important fact, we aim to employ autoregressive process for motion prediction and analytically characterize the user's successful viewing probability as a function of the delivered portion. Then, we consider the problem of wireless scheduling design with the goal of maximizing application-level throughput (i.e., average rate for successfully viewing the desired content) and service regularity performance (i.e., how often each user gets successful views) subject to the minimum required service rate and wireless interference constraints. As such, we incorporate users' successful viewing probabilities into our scheduling design and develop a scheduling algorithm that not only asymptotically achieves the optimal application-level throughput but also provides service regularity guarantees. Finally, we perform simulations to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm using a real dataset of users' head motion.","tags":null,"title":"Motion-Prediction-based Wireless Scheduling for Multi-User Panoramic Video Streaming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul G Carvalho","Fakhrizal Setiawan","Karizma Fahlevy","Beginer Subhan","Hawis Madduppa","Guangyu Zhu","Austin T Humphries"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617235200,"objectID":"e8940e69d926f3f3b861a6df3ed4d53d","permalink":"https://guangyuzhu.rbind.io/publication/carvalho-2021-fishing/","publishdate":"2023-11-03T00:48:54.849418Z","relpermalink":"/publication/carvalho-2021-fishing/","section":"publication","summary":"Marine food webs are structured through a combination of top-down and bottom-up processes. In coral reef ecosystems, fish size is related to life-history characteristics and size-based indicators can represent the distribution and flow of energy through the food web. Thus, size spectra can be a useful tool for investigating the impacts of both fishing and habitat condition on the health and productivity of coral reef fisheries. In addition, coral reef fisheries are often data-limited and size spectra analysis can be a relatively cost-effective and simple method for assessing fish populations. Abundance size spectra are widely used and quantify the relationship between organism size and relative abundance. Previous studies that have investigated the impacts of fishing and habitat condition together on the size distribution of coral reef fishes, however, have aggregated all fishes regardless of taxonomic identity. This leads to a poor understanding of how fishes with different feeding strategies, body size-abundance relationships, or catchability might be influenced by top-down and bottom-up drivers. To address this gap, we quantified size spectra slopes of carnivorous and herbivorous coral reef fishes across three regions of Indonesia representing a gradient in fishing pressure and habitat conditions. We show that fishing pressure was the dominant driver of size spectra slopes such that they became steeper as fishing pressure increased, which was due to the removal of large-bodied fishes. When considering fish functional groups separately, however, carnivore size spectra slopes were more heavily impacted by fishing than herbivores. Also, structural complexity, which can mediate predator-prey interactions and provisioning of resources, was a relatively important driver of herbivore size spectra slopes such that slopes were shallower in more complex habitats. Our results show that size spectra slopes can be used as indicators of fishing pressure on coral reef fishes, but aggregating fish regardless of trophic identity or functional role overlooks differential impacts of fishing pressure and habitat condition on carnivore and herbivore size distributions.","tags":null,"title":"Fishing and habitat condition differentially affect size spectra slopes of coral reef fishes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guangyu Zhu","Tingting Zhao"],"categories":[],"content":"Feature selection is central to contemporary high-dimensional data analysis.

In this paper, we propose the sparse envelope model, which is motivated by applications where some response variables are invariant with respect to changes of the predictors and have zero regression coefficients. The envelope estimator is consistent but not sparse, and in many situations it is important to identify the response variables for which the regression coefficients are zero. The sparse envelope model performs variable selection on the responses and preserves the efficiency gains offered by the envelope model. Response variable selection arises naturally in many applications, but has not been studied as thoroughly as predictor variable selection. In this paper, we discuss response variable selection in both the standard multivariate linear regression and the envelope contexts. In response variable selection, even if a response has zero coefficients, it should still be retained to improve the estimation efficiency of the nonzero coefficients. This is different from the practice in predictor variable selection. We establish consistency and the oracle property and obtain the asymptotic distribution of the sparse envelope estimator.","tags":null,"title":"Sparse envelope model: efficient estimation and response variable selection in multivariate linear regression","type":"publication"}]
